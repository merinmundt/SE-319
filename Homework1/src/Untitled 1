1) In order to compile, open up my 2 programs (Server.Java and Client.Java) through eclipse on my Homework1.zip

2) Then, once those are opened, first fun Server.Java as a Java Application. Once that is running and you read "Server Started" 
and "Waiting for Client" in the server prompt. You can now run the Client.Java program as a Java Application.

3)Once these are both running, In the client console, you should see ">Enter your name:" enter your name, and press enter TWO 
TIMES. Once this is done, you should see that you are connected with the server and your name should be on the Server console. 

4)The client can now see that they are prompted to type a text, and will not be prompted again until another person has 
joined the chat. If another person enters the chat room, via running Client.java again, they will go through step three for
themselves, and their messages will be showed on the server's console, and the other client's console with their names next 
to their written message. 

5) Anyone can talk at anytime. Will get prompted with "Text:" everytime someone replys or send a message. You will not be 
prompted if you were the last person to send a text message.
