Calculator:

I have three files for Task 1: calculator.html, calculator.js, and calculator.css. 
I used the css file to help me out and manage my borders and highlighting purposes. 

In order to compile my calculator project, you open the calculator.html page in a browser 
and select your first operand. If you want a negative number, you can press the (+/-) 
button after you press your operand. 

The operand you chose will highlight, and will continur to highligh until you press another
operand. The operator you choose will become red when you press it. 

Memory is set to 0 to begin with, and will not be set until you set it by pressing the M+ or
M- button. 

The order is Operand operator operand = " ". The answer recieved can be used as the first 
operand if you press an operator after the equals button.

Snake:

I have two files for Task 2: snake.html, and snake.js. 

In order to compile my snake project, you open the skake.html file in a browser and press the
start button. Once you press the start button, you will see your small black snake starting in
the middle of the left side of the box. it slowly moves, and will stop when it hits a side.
To restart it from that spot, just press start.

When restarting the line after it has gone out of bounds, you must turn the line around by 
pressing turn left or turn right twice after starting it. The function will continue to turn 
until you have turn the function around. 

The line will over lap other lines. Pressing turn left and turn right buttons follow their 
titles accordingly.
