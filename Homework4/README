In order to compile my program, you must have the readline-sync 
installed along with node.

Within the terminal, inorder to run my program, type 
"node binarycalc.js". This should run my program and it will 
proceed to ask you a series of questions. 

First question will be for the first number. Must be a binary number.
The next question will be for the operator. if the operater is >>
or << then it will give you the answer without asking for the second
number. If a different operator, then it will proceed to ask you for 
the second number. 

After each question, press enter. Your operation will print out the 
answer in binary form in the terminal. 

There is a folder within my Homework4 folder that is labeled 
Node_modules. This holds the readline_sync properties in order for 
it to work.
